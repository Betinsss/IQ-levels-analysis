## Project Overview

  The purpose of this project is to analyze the key user attributes such as
Rank, Country, IQ, Education Expenditure, Average Income, and Average
Temperature. We want to know if there's a connection between IQ and the money
spent on education or the average income of people. Likewise, we'll also look for
patterns in different regions and see if temperature affects IQ. In short, through
examining these data points, we aim to uncover insights into the socio-economic
and environmental conditions of different countries.
